This project contains the offical VOTO web app based on Next.js and Tailwind CSS. To learn more about VOTO, we kindly refer to our [documentation repository](https://github.com/voto-vote/voto).

## Development

First, copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill out the parameters.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Right now this app depends on the not-yet-open-sourced VOTO-portal.
> We intend to integrate the portal into this app in the future.

After that, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.
